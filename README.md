# Backpack DevTools Issues

<a href="https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/writing%20standard-the%20whole%20fruit-brightgreen" title="We believe writing good code is not only about writing good code. Itâ€™s also about the words around it. We aims to deliver both: code and words."></a>

The [Backpack DevTools](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/DevTools) repo is closed-source. That's where this public repo comes in:

- If you've discovered a bug, please open an issue here.
- If you want to suggest a feature, please open an issue here. 
- If you want to submit a PR, please open an issue here detailing it. If we agree to it, we'll add you to the code repo.

**Why does this exist?** Since the code repo is closed-source and Github charges per contributor per month... unfortunately... we can't give access to everybody who purchases it... it would be very _very_ costly. So keeping the issues and code separate is the best we can do, for the time being.
